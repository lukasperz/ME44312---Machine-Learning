# ME44312---Machine-Learning

For those that never worked with GitHub:

	1.	Pull:
	•	You fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and integrate them into your local branch.
	•	Command: git pull (same as git fetch + git merge).
	2.	Merge Branch:
	•	You combine changes from one branch into another.
	•	Usually, you merge a feature branch into the main branch after development.
	•	Command: git merge <branch-name>.
	3.	Pull Request (PR) (GitHub-specific):
	•	You request that someone reviews and merges your branch into the main branch.
	•	Typically used in teams for code review and collaboration.
	•	After approval, your branch gets merged into the target branch (e.g., main).
